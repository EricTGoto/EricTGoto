ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eric.<br>
I was drawn to software development because of the interesting problems that can be solved with code. I believe that what we are witnessing in the tech industry is just the beginning and I am excited to be a part of the rapidly evolving tech industry. <br>
Iâ€™m currently creating full stack projects with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am also experimenting with Django and PostgresSQL as Python is great to develop in.
